## 1. Purpose 

Unicorn companies or unicorn startups are private companies with a valuation 
over $1 billion. We have unicorn companies is various industries such as Artificial
Intelligence, E-commerce, Fintech, Internet software services, supply chain among 
all the industries.

A private company valued at more than $1 billion is referred to as a unicorn company 
or unicorn startup. There are 1,000 unicorns in the world as of March 2022. A 
few well-known ex-unicorns are Airbnb, Facebook, and Google. A decacorn, worth 
over $10 billion, and a hectocorn, worth over $100 billion, are examples of variants.
Discover each company's valuation, investors, and more by downloading the complete list right away.

The data set has been obtained from website `kaggle` https://www.kaggle.com/ 
data has been collected by https://www.cbinsights.com/research-unicorn-companies 
with scarping technology under CCO: Public Domain licensing.

Author/Contributor : Deep Contractor 

Investigative Questions:
> What is the valuation of the individual companies?
>
> Companies that has growth of more than 100 percent?
> 
> Investors that invested in companies that grew more than 100 percent?
>
> Top 5 countries with most unicorn companies?

What does the program do? 

- Introduce the dataset used for your project
  - State clearly the source, author, and last time the dataset has been updated
  - Describe the content of the data set
- Revise and rewrite the investigative questions in Project Proposal.
- The questions capture what the program's purpose isand what it does.
}

## 2. Approach 

Question 1:
What is the input?
What is the output?
What is the idea of the input-to output transformation?
Example:

How does the program achieve its purpose?

- Review the data transformations in the Design document.
- For each question
  - create a subheading (Heading 3 ###) and
  - describe the design approach at the high level and the data transformations.
}

## 3. Testing 

* Each question is implemented separately in modules.
* Each module is tested by three test cases by using three modules empty, first_5 & last_2.
* The speciality of input entry file is that it has the bogus data included. Hence, this is the file which need to
be tested for the code to be implemented on original data file as this also performs cleaning of data.
* The alternative testing method is to use the spreadsheet . I have already sorted the data and given
formulas to show the results in the spreadsheets. The spreadsheets are available in xlsx folder of data
folder.

{
<--- Heading 2 ##

Describe test cases that demonstrate the correctness of the solution.
Make sure that testing covers all the methods in the implementation of the program.

### 3.x Name and describe the module and corresponding class for testing a particular method <-- Heading 3 ###
#### 3.x.y Name and describe each testing method <-- Heading 4 ####
  - These are subsections of 3.x above.
  - Testing method name should be suggestive of the type of test.
  - Each test describes specific inputs and expected results.
  - Describe the **alternative ways of getting and testingthe results**.
}


## 4. Results 

{
<--- Heading 2 ##
