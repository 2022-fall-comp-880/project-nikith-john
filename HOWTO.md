# How To Implement:

## Cloning into local repo:
* In gitbash, "mkdir <project name>".
* "cd <project name>" to go to the directory.
* "git clone https://github.com/2022-fall-comp-880/project-nikith-john.git" to 
clone the project.
 
## Running the program
* "pip install â€“r requirements.txt" to install the libraries from requirements.txt.
* First run "unicorn.py" module with python. We will get the results of all the
methods.
* Then run each test case individually.
