## Motivation 
> The project is on the Unicorn companies. We take top 20 Unicorns in the world.
> There are investors that invested in these unicorn companies. Some 
> companies must've performed really good whereas other companies might've
> performed relatively less.


## Investigative Questions

> Companies that has growth of more than 100 percent?
> 
> Investors that invested in companies that grew more than 100 percent?
>
> Top 5 countries with most unicorn companies? 

## Approach 
> The project focuses on top 20 Unicorn companies globally. The dataset is taken 
> from Kaggle by "Deep Contractor". Below is the link to the source:
> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/deepcontractor/unicorn-companies-dataset
> The dataset was last updated in February 2022.
> 
> The dataset is of 1075 rows and 10 attributes. 
>
> The input given is of the data structure list and the output should be 
> dictionary with key and values.

## Expected Results 
> The dataset I chose contains many factors, but I am selecting the required
> attributes.
> 
> One method should return the list of companies above certain valuation. 
> 
> The other method returns the companies that has grown more than
> 100 percent.
> 
> The last method returns the countries with most unicorn companies.
